In the maze of late-night study sessions and looming deadlines, many of us have turned to YouTube for a lifeline and often found it in the clear, concise explanations of Indian STEM tutors. This project explores how these creators have redefined digital learning, transforming YouTube into a global classroom. By analyzing YouTube metadata, including trends in video uploads, viewership, and engagement metrics, we trace the growth of Indian STEM content over time. Aiming to use sentiment analysis on comments, we want to uncover what resonates most with viewers, whether it be teaching styles or accessibility. To further enrich our understanding, we want to deploy advanced keyword classification based on hierarchical structures of STEM topics and measure content alignment through cosine similarity. From the heartfelt comments of grateful learners to the recurring communities built around these channels, this project tells the story of how Indian tutors are not just saving studentsâ€”but shaping the future of inclusive, diverse, and empowering STEM education worldwide.
